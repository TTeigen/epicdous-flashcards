          <p>What are <em>Operators</em> and how are these <strong>" + , - , *, / , % "</strong> used in JavaScript?</p>
          <ul class= "answer">
          <li><p><strong>Operators</strong> are symbols that tell the compiler to perform specific mathematical or logical manipulations. In this tutorial , we will try to cover the most commonly used operators in programming.</p></li>
          <li> <strong> + </strong> is used for addition in arithmetic or to concatenate strings.</li>
          <li> <strong> - </strong> is used for subtraction in arithmetic.</li>
          <li> <strong> * </strong> is used for multiplication in arithmetic.</li>
          <li> <strong> / </strong> is used for division in arithmetic.</li>
          <li> <strong> % </strong> is used for finding the remainder of after division in arithmetic.</li>

        <div id="question2">
          <p>What are Variables and Variables naming conventions?</p>
          <ul class= "answer">
          <p>In programming, a variable is a value that can change, depending on conditions or on information passed to the program.</p><p>And naming conventions is Naming convention (programming) In computer programming, a naming convention are a set of rules for choosing the character sequence to be used for identifiers which denote variables, types, functions, and other entities in source code and documentation.</p>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div id="question3">
          <p>What are Functions? What are Methods?</p>
          <ul class= "answer">
          <p><strong>Functions</strong> are blocks of organized, reusable code that is used to perform a single, related action.</p>
          <p><strong>Methods </strong> in object-oriented programming is a procedure associated with a class. A method defines the behavior of the objects that are created from the class. </p>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div id="question4">
          <p>What are Arguments and Paramaters?</p>
          <ul class= "answer">
          <p><strong>An Argument</strong> is an independent items, or variables, that contain data or codes.
          <p><strong>A Paramater</strong> or a formal argument, is a special kind of variable, used in a subroutine to refer to one of the pieces of data provided as input to the subroutine.</p>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div id="question5">
          <p>What does Return do? And what does it mean to "chain methods?"</p>
          <ul class= "answer">
          <p><strong>The Return</strong> statement terminates the execution of a function and returns control to the calling function.</p>
          <p><strong>Method Chaining</strong> is a common syntax for invoking multiple method calls in object-oriented programming languages. Each method returns an object, allowing the calls to be chained together in a single statement without requiring variables to store the intermediate results.</p>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div id="question6">
          <p>What are Strings? What are Booleans?</p>
          <ul class= "answer">
          <p><strong>A String</strong> is traditionally a sequence of characters, either as a literal constant or as some kind of variable.</p>
          <p><strong>Boolean</strong> data type is a data type that has one of two possible values (usually denoted true and false)</p>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div id="question7">
          <p>What does 'Undefined' mean? What does NaN stand for and when does it occur?</p>
          <ul class= "answer">
          <p><strong>The Undefined</strong> property indicates that a variable has not been assigned a value, or not declared at all.</p>
          <p><strong>NaN</strong> stands for not a number, and is a numeric data type value representing an undefined or unrepresentable value, especially in floating-point arithmetic.</p>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div id="question8">
          <p> What does 'alert' do?</p>
          <ul class= "answer">
          <p><strong>Alert</strong> is a method that displays an alert box with a specified message and an OK button. An alert box is often used if you want to make sure information comes through to the user.</p>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div id="question9">
          <p>What is an escape character? How do you comment and why?</p>
          <ul class= "answer">
          <p><strong>An escape character</strong> is a character which invokes an alternative interpretation on subsequent characters in a character sequence.</p>
          <p><strong>Comments</strong>  are a programmer-readable explanation or annotation in the source code of a computer program. They are added with the purpose of making the source code easier for humans to understand</p>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div id="question10">
          <p>What is an Attribute?</p>
          <ul class= "answer">
          <p><strong>An Attribute</strong> is a specification that defines a property of an object, element, or file. It may also refer to or set the specific value for a given instance of such.</p>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div id="question11">
          <p>What is JavaScript?</p>
          <ul class= "answer">
          <p><strong>JavaScript (JS)</strong> is an object-oriented computer programming language commonly used to create interactive effects within web browsers.</p>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div id="question12">
          <p>What is jQuery?</p>
          <ul class= "answer">
          <p><strong>jQuery</strong> is a lightweight, "write less, do more", JavaScript library. The purpose of jQuery is to make it much easier to use JavaScript on your website. jQuery takes a lot of common tasks that require many lines of JavaScript code to accomplish, and wraps them into methods that you can call with a single line of code.</p>
